This project consists of 4 distinct exercises that demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript functions, classes,dynamic function manipulation, and time complexity analysis. Each exercise tackles a different scenario:

1- Student Report generator: 
    This module processes a list of student objects, calculates the average of there scores, and provides a grade. 

2- Bank Account System: 
    Initializes a class that simulates a basic banking system which includes methode: constructor(creating account object), deposits, withdraws, transfers, account balance summary, account transaction history.

3- Dynamice To-Do List functionality in website:
    Adds interactive functionality to a basic webpage; user input, button action (add task), dynamic list update, toggles "completed" style by clicking.

4- Time complexity analysis: calculation of the first 2 exercises time complexity by seperating each code block and referencing it through the question itself.
